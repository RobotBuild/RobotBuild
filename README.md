Hello, interwebs people!
My name is Luke and this is my github where I store the projects I work on so others can learn or use it in their own.
I am a huge fan of the opensource community, I have learned most of what I know from others who make their work available and 
I aim to honor that spirit! 
This is a constant work in progress, but only finished code and projects will be posted. If you wish to get in contact with me
you can reach me at RobotBuild24.7@gmail.com
Thanks for stopping by!
